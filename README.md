# apps_script--GSuite_API

## Organisation
1. Main.gs - main code used by other function
2. users.gs - pulling down user data
3. chromeOS.gs - pulling your enroled ChromeOS devices data
4. groups.gs - list all of your google groups

## Basic info
1. At the moment code doesn't require using "project properties" as everything is done with native apps-acript to G Suite API, script does only things you can do as an admin.
